# Restfulapi
My first restfull api

## Project Overview

This project was developed to create a user-friendly API for managing user data. Our main objectives were:
- To implement GET routes that allow users to fetch data based on different criteria like user ID, username, and profession.
- To ensure that the API is responsive and can handle requests efficiently.
- To learn about API development and improve our programming skills in handling data requests.

Throughout this project, we learned a lot about server-side programming, JSON formatting, and enhancing the performance of an API to manage data requests smoothly.

## Testing Screenshots

Here are the screenshots from our testing process, demonstrating the functionality and expected outputs for each of the GET routes in our API:

- **Fetching a User by ID**
